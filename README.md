# What is this project?
Hello! My name is Aaryan Srivastava, and this project is a submission for the
Coding + Programming Event in FBLA. This project is composed of multiple parts
which will be explained below, but there are also comments within the code itself
to help you understand it's purpose. Simply put, this project contains a
database (json file) in which I extract 5 questions on random and display them
on a server (think of it as a local website). I then allow the user to input his
or her answers, and then I generate a scoresheet containing all the information.
* hello world
* my name is Aaryan.
* my name is not Aaryan.
